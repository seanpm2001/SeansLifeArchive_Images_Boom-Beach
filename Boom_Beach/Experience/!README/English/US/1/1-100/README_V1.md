# Boom Beach Experience

Boom Beach has been a consistent game for me for some of my childhood and early adult life. I started playing it in Middle School, and have gone through 1 account (Android)

I have not spent money on this game, but I have spent a lot of time on it. I never played the game on iOS.

## Android

My Boom Beach experience began on Android in 2014, as I had access to Android a year before I stopped using iOS. I commonly used alt accounts, including on BlueStacks. I no longer have access to any of my alt accounts. Some have even been hijacked. I had less alt accounts compared to Clash of Clans.

I would play before school. For whatever reason, I liked doing random battles, and barraging my riflemen on purpose. I no longer do this. During my YouTube career, I made many videos regarding Boom Beach and 9 other games, but I focused on Boom Beach for mega crab videos, where I received my first online hate comment and violent threat. Looking back, I should not have given attention to it, as it was likely a troll.

I stopped playing in 2018, but resumed in 2020. Although outdated, I do not plan to leave the `clashoftrm` task force, or change my username from the `seanwallawalla` handle, although the task force name is both obsolete.

I stopped doing player attacks in 2021, and focused mainly on mega crab events, campaign attacks, and Dr. Terror attacks.
