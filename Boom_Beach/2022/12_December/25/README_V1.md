I watched a recent battle replay, I feel that ranged attacks are really unfair, because there are only 5 buildings in my base that can target these troops (3 rocket launchers and a shock launcher) and they hardly do any damage to tanks.

Today, I upgraded my 8th landing craft to level 12, did the usual battles, power stone conversion, submarine diving, then I quit - 2021 October 10th.

I plan to upgrade all my boom cannons to level 12, then to level 13, and whatever else level I can get them to with my current headquarters level. Additionally, I upgraded my Grenadier to level 6 for 5.9 million gold, which is the last upgrade I can currently do with the armory level I have. Gold will then be useless again.

I had a short session again today. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops on any stages except for stage 4, where I lost 1 scorcher, and tage 5, where I lost 4 more scorchers, but still won. I continued power stone conversion again this week. Stone has become very evident to be one of the most difficult resources to get in this game, and it is making it impossible to upgrade anything on a weekly basis. This week, I wasn't able to upgrade anything, but I am still woprking on getting a machine gun to look cooler than a level 15 machine gun. Disappointingly, a level 20 machine gun still looks the same as the previous 6 levels. I additionally plan to upgrade all my boom cannons to level 12, then to level 13, and whatever else level I can get them to with my current headquarters level. I would have spent 200 diamonds to get the upgrade this week, but I would rather wait until next week. I did not get attacked since I last played. I did a submarine dive. Afterwards, I quit. - 2022, Sunday, October 9th

I had a really bad, short session today. The game didn't have any updates today. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors island, not losing any troops on any stages until stage 5, where I lost 8 scorcher, where I may have had the chance to succeed, but I got kicked out of the game, despite no network problems. SUPERCELL wouldn't even let me see myself fail. I continued power stone conversion again this week. Stone has become very evident to be one of the most difficult resources to get in this game, and it is making it impossible to upgrade anything on a weekly basis. This week, I was not able to do any upgrades. I went to receive 150 free diamonds, and a useless 2nd builder (because there is no point to a 2nd builder when it takes so long to be able to afford to upgrade a single building) and SUPERCELL said it gave me the diamonds, but I apparently didn't know I had less than 3000 diamonds at the time, and thought I got scammed out of them (checking my logs now, I didn't get scammed, although this session wasn't very fun other than that) I am starting to see why some people dislike Boom Beach. I have a new upgrade in mind: getting one of my machine guns to the highest level possible. I have noted that a max level machine gun can actually widdle down the health of my scorcher pretty quickly, and the level 20 and beyond machine guns look really cool as well. I additionally plan to upgrade all my boom cannons to level 12, then to level 13, and whatever else level I can get them to with my current headquarters level. I did not get attacked this week, so that's good. I did a submarine dive. Afterwards, I quit. - 2022, Sunday, December 25th

### 3D Touch issues

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

While playing today, I constantly dealt with issues related to my posture of holding the device (which caused constant errors, and sporadic screengrabs) and the return of an annoying bug that made the game do nothing but zoom in and out with little control. The only fix is to turn the screen off, back on, quickly minimize the game, maximimize it, then quickly turn the screen off again, back on, quickly minimize the game again, and maximize it. It was so annoying. Sometimes it would start doing it again after the next screengrab. - 2021 November 28th

3D touch issues were minimal today, but screenshot issues were through the roof. I find it idiotic that the power button on my device goes towards a voice "Assistant" that I don't use, rather than its actual purpose. Why not make a VA/Bixby button? While you are at it, why not make a screenshot button? You know, no VA button, virtual assistants don't need a button, a search assistant doesn't need a button. - 2022 January 30th to 2022 February 6th

I did not do any player attacks yet again this week, but I got attacked twice since I last played, the first attack was unsuccessful, and the second attack was successful, but it wasn't much of a loss to me, as I didn't have very much wood, or stone on me, and I had far too much gold and iron. The attacker probably needed it more than I do, too bad you can't just donate resources to people. - 2022, Sunday, September 4th

I did not do any player attacks yet again this week, but I did get attacked since I last played. The attack was successful, and I ranked down. As usual, I can't even see the replay to see what went wrong. I lost a lot of resources, and if this becomes common, gameplay is going to be difficult. - 2022, Sunday, December 11th

#### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20. I am continuing the goal again, but I am likely to break it again. - As of July 25th 2021
