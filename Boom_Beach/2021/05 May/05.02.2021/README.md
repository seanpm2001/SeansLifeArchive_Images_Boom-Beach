# Boom Beach session May 2nd 2021

I had a normal length Boom Beach session and made some progress. I currently don't like how difficult it is to upgrade buildings though.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I had to cut down most of my trees, and still pay 10 diamonds to upgrade a sniper tower to level 19.

### Submarine

I went for a dive with the submarine that will be ready next week.

### Power stones

I converted 14 power stones today, but didn't place any new statues.

### Upgrades

I had difficulty doing upgrades today. I upgraded my sniper tower to level 19 today, but wanted to do so many other upgrades.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and lost 2 scorchers on the last battle. I didn't make very much profit from it.

### War Factory level 45

Knowing I likely wouldn't win, I attempted a battle on the War Factory with 5 out of 7 of my scorchers, just to see how much I could destroy. I found I could take out quite a lot, but will still need to upgrade more to conquer this base.

## Overview

See above.
