# Boom Beach session May 16th 2021

I had a normal length Boom Beach session and made some progress. I currently don't like how difficult it is to upgrade buildings though.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I abandoned my level 20 headquarters goal for now, and decided to upgrade an Iron Storage to level 9, and didn't get to upgrade any defense buildings.

### Submarine

I went for a dive with the submarine that will be ready next week. I received a decent reward from last weeks voyage.

### Power stones

I converted 21 power stones today, but didn't place any new statues. I am considering starting to strategize my statue construction.

### Upgrades

I had difficulty doing upgrades today. I wasn't able to do any, and it is really difficult to save up for them. Recent attacks against my base resulted in some loot lost, but not enough to prevent me from getting close to upgrading.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles until the 5th one. I was able to easily take all of the bases, as the headquarters was poorly placed and I didn't even need to destroy 20-80% of the base to get to it safely. I didn't make very much profit from it for my base level.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021)

## Overview

See above.
