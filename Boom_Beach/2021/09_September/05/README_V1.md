## Touring

I did not view any other bases today.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 6 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops until stage 5, and stage 6 was purely to see how well I could steamroll a level 60 base. I could do well, but not enough to warrant a success/

### Warship

I began building my warship a few weeks ago, and I didn't make any progress on it today, I am hoping the base doesn't reset each season, or else I won't continue doing this as much. I did not do any upgrades or any attacks.

The warship does reset each season, I no longer have interest in it. - August 1st 2021

### Player attacks

I did not do any player attacks today.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20. I am continuing the goal again, but I am likely to break it again. - As of July 25th 2021

## Overview

See above.
