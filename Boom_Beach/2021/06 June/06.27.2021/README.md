# Boom Beach session June 27th 2021

I had a very long and very enjoyable Boom Beach session and made some progress. I had a lot of nostalgia while playing and had a very good time.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I built 4 new mines, got a new landing craft and got it to level 3, and ended off with construction of my 2nd shock launcher. I chose it over the boom cannon, as I needed to build a ranged building first. I also moved my base around to move long range defenses further back, so that they could inflict more damage before they could get destroyed.

### Submarine

I began a submarine dive today.

### Power stones

I did some catchup on Power Stone conversion today. It is still a very slow process.

### Upgrades

I built my 8th landing craft today, I still need to level it up across several sessions before I can fit an 8th scorcher onto it. I upgraded it twice today, getting it to level 3.

I began to upgrade my mines to level 19 today.

I began construction on my 2nd shock launcher today.

## Touring

I toured a top base, and found that the current max headquarters level is 24. I now want the level 21 headquarters, as it looks really cool, but there is still a ways to go first. 

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 3 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles. I didn't go for stage 4 or further, as I didn't feel like continuing with it.

### Life Leech Mega Crab

I did the first 10 stages of the Life Leech Mega Crab today and got tons of resources.

### Player attacks

I did not do any player attacks today.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20.

## Overview

See above.
