# Boom Beach session June 13th 2021

I had a short Boom Beach session and made some progress. I currently don't like how difficult it is to upgrade buildings though.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I was unable to upgrade any buildings today, I am now saving up for a headquarters upgrade, but I will try harder to go through with it this time. I kept with the goal, and I made it closer today. I could have upgraded nearly any building, but I am saving up for a headquarters upgrade. I came very close today, and decided to wait 1+ more sessions and not spend gems.

### Submarine

I began a submarine dive today.

### Power stones

I caught up on Power Stone conversion today, but there wasn't much to do.

### Upgrades

I did not do any upgrades today. I am saving up for the headquarters level 20 upgrade.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles. I didn't go for stage 5 or further, as I didn't feel like continuing with it.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021)

## Overview

See above.
