# Boom Beach session June 20th 2021

I had a short Boom Beach session and made some progress. I currently don't like how difficult it is to upgrade buildings though.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I was finally able to upgrade my headquarters to level 20 today.

### Submarine

I began a submarine dive today.

### Power stones

I did not catchup on Power Stone conversion today, but there wasn't much to do.

### Upgrades

I saved up enough and finally upgraded my headquarters to level 20 today.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles. I didn't go for stage 5 or further, as I didn't feel like continuing with it.

### Player attacks

I did 2 player attacks to get additional resources, so that I could upgrade my headquarters to level 20. I was successful on this.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20.


## Overview

See above.
