# Boom Beach session June 6th 2021

I had a short Boom Beach session and made some progress. I currently don't like how difficult it is to upgrade buildings though.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I was unable to upgrade any buildings today, I am now saving up for a headquarters upgrade, but I will try harder to go through with it this time. I kept with the goal, and I made it closer today. I could have upgraded nearly any building, but I am saving up for a headquarters upgrade.

### Submarine

I forgot to go diving with the submarine today.

### Power stones

I did not convert power stones today, as I forgot.

### Upgrades

I did not do any upgrades today. I am saving up for the headquarters level 20 upgrade.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles. I didn't go for stage 5 or further, as I didn't think I would win. Looking at it now, I should have at least tried.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021)

## Overview

See above.
