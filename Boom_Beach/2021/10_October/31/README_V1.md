I continued to play on my main base today. I began upgrading my boom cannon to level 5, and I forgot to do power stone conversion afterwards. I did some trades today as well. - August 15th 2021

As usual, I continued on my main base today. I chose to upgrade my new shock launcher to level 2 today, instead of upgrading my boom cannon to level 6. I did some trades and power stone conversion today as well. - August 22nd 2021

I upgraded my new boom cannon to level 6 and did power stone conversion and collection. - August 29th 2021

I was going to save up and upgrade my armory, but instead I upgraded a boom cannon to level 12 - 2021 September 5th

I upgraded my new boom cannon to level 7 and did power stone conversion and collection. - 2021 September 12th

I upgraded my new landing craft to level 11 and did power stone conversion and collection. - 2021 September 19th

I upgraded one of my 3 rocket launchers to level 9, and did mass power stone conversion and collection  2021 October 3rd

I watched a recent battle replay, I feel that ranged attacks are really unfair, because there are only 5 buildings in my base that can target these troops (3 rocket launchers and a shock launcher) and they hardly do any damage to tanks. I only won the battle, as the opponent ran out of time. Today, I upgraded my 8th landing craft to level 12, did the usual battles, power stone conversion, submarine diving, then I quit - 2021 October 10th.

I upgraded my 8th landing craft to level 13 and did power stone conversion and collection. - 2021 October 17th

I had a normal length session today. I got really good rewards early on, and spent it on my iron mine, to increase my iron production. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday base, and lost 7 scorchers on the last battle, but still won. I also did power stone conversion, did a submarine dive, and browsed around a bit before quitting. - 2021 October 24th

</details>

I had a very long session today. I was forced to update the game first thing. I found a really good dive location, and find out that there was a mega crab event today. I attacked the first 3 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday base, then attacked the first 14 stages of the Halloween Mega Crab event, losing 2 scorchers on stage 12, 2 more scorchers on stage 13, and 3 scorchers on stage 14. I also did mass power stone conversion, did a submarine dive, and browsed around a bit before quitting. I upgraded my shock launcher to level 3, I wanted to upgrade my armory, but I didn't have the resources - 2021 October 31st

I did the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops. The game updated in the background, and kicked me out of the second battle, but I still won. Gameplay was very difficult today due to the touch back button. - 2021 September 19th

I did the first 3 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops, as I was careful, and wanted to attack the beastly mega crab. I got a decent amount of resources from these. - 2021 September 26th

I did the first 3 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops. I decided not to do a 4th battle, as I didn't feel like it, and I didn't want to risk losing scorchers before a landing craft upgrade. - 2021 October 10th

I did the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops until the last battle, where I lost 7 scorchers. I couldn't do the 6th stage, as even if I were to rush the reconstruction of my 8 scorchers, I would stand no chance against the base. - 2021 October 24th

### Beastly Mega Crab

I successfully destroyed the first 12 stages of the Beastly Mega crab, not losing troops until stage 11, where I lost 4 scorchers, and stage 12, where I lost 3 more scorchers. I made a bounty of loot from these attacks. - 2021 September 26th

I made a pretty good amount from the attacks. I like how the halloween mortars scare troops and make them act weird/go back/go back into the landing craft, etc.. - 2021 October 31st

### Warship

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

I began building my warship a few weeks ago, and I didn't make any progress on it today, I am hoping the base doesn't reset each season, or else I won't continue doing this as much. I did not do any upgrades or any attacks.

The warship does reset each season, I no longer have interest in it. - August 1st 2021 to 2021 September 19th

I accidentally went to the warship today, and got a good reward of 50 gems and 12 trader tickets. I didn't do anything else here. - 2021 September 26th

</details>

I did not go to the warship today. - 2021 October 3rd to 2021 October 31st

I did not do any player attacks today. I did not get attacked since I last played. - 2021 September 19th to 2021 October 24th

#### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20. I am continuing the goal again, but I am likely to break it again. - As of July 25th 2021

## Overview
