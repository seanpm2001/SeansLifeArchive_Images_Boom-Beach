I had a much longer session today that I enjoyed a lot more than last week.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I began upgrading my boom cannon to level 5, and I forgot to do power stone conversion afterwards. I did some trades today as well. - August 15th 2021

As usual, I continued on my main base today. I chose to upgrade my new shock launcher to level 2 today, instead of upgrading my boom cannon to level 6. I did some trades and power stone conversion today as well. - August 22nd 2021

I upgraded my new boom cannon to level 6 and did power stone conversion and collection. - August 29th 2021

I was going to save up and upgrade my armory, but instead I upgraded a boom cannon to level 12 - 2021 September 5th

I upgraded my new boom cannon to level 7 and did power stone conversion and collection. - 2021 September 12th

I upgraded my new landing craft to level 11 and did power stone conversion and collection. - 2021 September 19th

I upgraded my new boom cannon to level 8, and did mass power stone conversion and collection  2021 September 26th

I upgraded one of my 3 rocket launchers to level 9, and did mass power stone conversion and collection  2021 October 3rd

I watched a recent battle replay, I feel that ranged attacks are really unfair, because there are only 5 buildings in my base that can target these troops (3 rocket launchers and a shock launcher) and they hardly do any damage to tanks. I only won the battle, as the opponent ran out of time. Today, I upgraded my 8th landing craft to level 12, did the usual battles, power stone conversion, submarine diving, then I quit - 2021 October 10th.

I upgraded my 8th landing craft to level 13 and did power stone conversion and collection. - 2021 October 17th

I had a normal length session today. I got really good rewards early on, and spent it on my iron mine, to increase my iron production. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday base, and lost 7 scorchers on the last battle, but still won. I also did power stone conversion, did a submarine dive, and browsed around a bit before quitting. - 2021 October 24th

I had a very long session today. I was forced to update the game first thing. I found a really good dive location, and find out that there was a mega crab event today. I attacked the first 3 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday base, then attacked the first 14 stages of the Halloween Mega Crab event, losing 2 scorchers on stage 12, 2 more scorchers on stage 13, and 3 scorchers on stage 14. I also did mass power stone conversion, did a submarine dive, and browsed around a bit before quitting. I upgraded my shock launcher to level 3, I wanted to upgrade my armory, but I didn't have the resources - 2021 October 31st

I had a very long session today. I attacked the first 4 stages of Dr. Terros island, did mass power stone conversion, did a submarine dive, and browsed around a bit before quitting. I upgraded my shock launcher to level 3, I wanted to upgrade my armory, but I didn't have the resources - 2021 Sunday November 7th

I had a long session today. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors island, did mass power stone conversion, did a submarine dive, and browsed around a bit before quitting. I upgraded my 3rd iron storage to level 10, which like other non-HQ upgrades, felt like a waste. I wanted to upgrade my armory, but couldn't afford it, and didn't want to save up yet. - 2021 Sunday November 14th

I had a short session today. I attacked the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors island, did some power stone conversion, did a weak submarine dive, and browsed around a bit before quitting. I upgraded my 8th landing craft to level 15 today, which like other non-HQ upgrades, felt like a waste. I wanted to upgrade my armory, but couldn't afford it, and didn't want to save up yet. This was the only upgrade I could afford today. I got attacked twice since I last played, but successfully defended against both. - 2021 Sunday November 21st

I wanted to upgrade my armory, but couldn't afford it, and didn't want to save up yet. It was a hard decision on what to upgrade. I got attacked twice since I last played, and lost against both. Luckily I have a high level vault, so I didn't lose too much. - 2021 Sunday November 28th

### 3D Touch issues

While playing today, I constantly dealt with issues related to my posture of holding the device (which caused constant errors, and sporadic screengrabs) and the return of an annoying bug that made the game do nothing but zoom in and out with little control. The only fix is to turn the screen off, back on, quickly minimize the game, maximimize it, then quickly turn the screen off again, back on, quickly minimize the game again, and maximize it. It was so annoying. Sometimes it would start doing it again after the next screengrab. - 2021 November 28th

There were no severe 3D touch issues today - 2021, Sunday, December 5th to 2021, Sunday, December 26th

### Warship

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

I began building my warship a few weeks ago, and I didn't make any progress on it today, I am hoping the base doesn't reset each season, or else I won't continue doing this as much. I did not do any upgrades or any attacks.

The warship does reset each season, I no longer have interest in it. - August 1st 2021 to 2021 September 19th

I accidentally went to the warship today, and got a good reward of 50 gems and 12 trader tickets. I didn't do anything else here. - 2021 September 26th

</details>

I did not go to the warship today. - 2021 Sunday October 3rd to 2021, Sunday, December 26th

### Player attacks

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

I did not do any player attacks today. I got attacked since I last played, and it made progress a bit more difficult today. - 2021 September 12th

</details>

I did not do any player attacks today. I did not get attacked since I last played. - 2021, Sunday, September 19th to 2021, Sunday December 26th

#### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20. I am continuing the goal again, but I am likely to break it again. - As of July 25th 2021
