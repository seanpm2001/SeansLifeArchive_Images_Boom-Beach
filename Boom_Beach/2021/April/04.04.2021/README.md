# Boom Beach session April 4th 2021

I had a long Boom Beach session today. My island residents are still celebrating the recent destruction of 2 Lieutenant Hammerman bases (lvl 40 and lvl 50) in a single day.

## Dr. Terror

With the super warrior gunboat ability, I was able to reach and defeat stage 5 of Dr. Terror B today.

## Upgrades

I began to upgrade my vault to level 18 today. I was going to upgrade my boom mine in the armory, but I didn't accumulate enough gold.

## Mass fragmentation

I converted hundreds of various crystal fragments to shards today, this took a while.

## Demotion

Someone attacked me and took lots of resources (which will really help them out, I have a huge supply of resources open for collection right now) and I was demoted from Lieutenant to cadet (260 -> 259)

## Overall

I had a good time, and made decent progress.
