# Boom Beach session July 11th 2021

I had a shorter session today that I enjoyed a lot less than last week, but I still enjoyed it slightly.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I began 3 different landing craft upgrades, unfortunately wasting diamonds to do so. I will save back up to and above 1000 diamonds another time.

### Submarine

I began a submarine dive today in a really good region.

### Power stones

I did some catchup on Power Stone conversion today. It is still a very slow process.

### Upgrades

I did several landing craft upgrades today, with only a few more (3-4) needed to be able to have an 8th scorcher.

## Touring

I did not view any other bases today.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles until stage 5, where I lost 5 out of 7 scorchers. I didn't go for stage 6 or further, as I didn't feel like continuing with it, as I knew I wouldn;t win.

### Warship

I began building my warship last week, and I didn't make any progress on it today, I am hoping the base doesn't reset each season, or else I won't continue doing this as much. I did not do any upgrades or any attacks.

### Player attacks

I did not do any player attacks today.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20. I am continuing the goal again, but I am likely to break it again.

## Overview

See above.
