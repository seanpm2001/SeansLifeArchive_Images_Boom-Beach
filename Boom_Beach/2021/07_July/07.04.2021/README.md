# Boom Beach session July 4th 2021

I had a shorter session today that I enjoyed a lot less than last week, but I still enjoyed it slightly.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I began building a boom cannon, that is the only upgrade I did.

### Submarine

I began a submarine dive today.

### Power stones

I did some catchup on Power Stone conversion today. It is still a very slow process.

### Upgrades

I did not do any upgrades today.

## Touring

I did not view any other bases today.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles. I didn't go for stage 5 or further, as I didn't feel like continuing with it.

### Warship

I began building my warship today, I am hoping the base doesn't reset each season, or else I won't continue doing this as much. I did many upgrades, and 1 successful attack.

### Player attacks

I did not do any player attacks today.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20. I am continuing the goal again, but I am likely to break it again.

## Overview

See above.
