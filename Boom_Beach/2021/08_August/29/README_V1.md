# Boom Beach session August 29th 2021

I had a shorter session today that I enjoyed a bit more than last week.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I began upgrading my boom cannon to level 5, and I forgot to do power stone conversion afterwards. I did some trades today as well. - August 15th 2021

As usual, I continued on my main base today. I chose to upgrade my new shock launcher to level 2 today, instead of upgrading my boom cannon to level 6. I did some trades and power stone conversion today as well. - August 22nd 2021

I upgraded my new boom cannon to level 6 and did power stone conversion and collection. - August 29th 2021

### Submarine

I didn't begin a new dive today. - August 22nd 2021 to August 29th 2021

### Power stones

I did some massive catchup on Power Stone conversion today. It is still a very slow process. - August 8th 2021

I forgot to catch up on power stone conversion today. - August 15th 2021

### Level up

On July 18th 2021, I leveled up to level 54. - july 18th 2021

I did not level up today, and I made very little level progress today. - July 25th 2021 to August 29th 2021

## Touring

I did not view any other bases today.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 3 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles.

### Warship megacrab

I made some progress on the Warship Megacrab today, losing all my scorchers and going up to stage 15. I used heavy amounts of artillery and gunboat boosts and no troop deployment for several attacks, to weaken the base so I could steamroll it.

### Warship

I began building my warship a few weeks ago, and I didn't make any progress on it today, I am hoping the base doesn't reset each season, or else I won't continue doing this as much. I did not do any upgrades or any attacks.

The warship does reset each season, I no longer have interest in it. - August 1st 2021

### Player attacks

I did not do any player attacks today.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20. I am continuing the goal again, but I am likely to break it again. - As of July 25th 2021

## Overview

See above.
