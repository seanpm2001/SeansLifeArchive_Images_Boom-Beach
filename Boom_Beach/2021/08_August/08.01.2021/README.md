# Boom Beach session August 1st 2021

I had a shorter session today that I enjoyed a lot less than last week.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I began upgrading my vault to level 20, and I did tons of power stone conversion afterwards. I traded gold for stone 3 times, and got some small rewards from the trading boat.

### Submarine

I began a submarine dive today in a poorer good region.

### Power stones

I did some massive catchup on Power Stone conversion today. It is still a very slow process.

### Upgrades

I did 1 upgrade today, upgrading my vault to levl 20.

### Level up

On July 18th 2021, I leveled up to level 54. - july 18th 2021

I did not level up today, and I made very little level progress today. - July 25th 2021

I did not level up today, and I made very little level progress today. - August 1st 2021

## Touring

I did not view any other bases today.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 5 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles until stage 5, where I lost 1 scorcher, as it went unnecessary into danger. I decided not go for stage 6 or 7, as I knew I wouldn't succeed. I also found that max level machine guns actually do damage against tank units, a max level machine gun spraying onto my level 2 scorcher was able to drain its health to near dustruction

### Warship

I began building my warship a few weeks ago, and I didn't make any progress on it today, I am hoping the base doesn't reset each season, or else I won't continue doing this as much. I did not do any upgrades or any attacks.

The warship does reset each season, I no longer have interest in it. - August 1st 2021

### Player attacks

I did not do any player attacks today.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021) I failed on this goal on June 20th 2021, as I was desperate to get my headquarters to level 20. I am continuing the goal again, but I am likely to break it again. - As of July 25th 2021

## Overview

See above.
