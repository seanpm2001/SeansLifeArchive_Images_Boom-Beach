# Boom Beach March 28th 2021 session

I had a really long and fun session today.

## Trader

I opened many trader crates today. I would open all of them, but I decided to stop, due to an overflow of iron

## Dr. terror part 2

I made it up to stage 5 without losing any scorchers, although I didn't attempt stage 5

## Anniversary Mega crab

I made some progress on the Anniversary Mega Crab, getting to stage 12, and getting lots of loot (but nothing compared to opening over a dozen trader crates) it is still fun, and I quit when the stage killed 5 out of 7 of my scorchers

## Skulptor

I am still trying to get rid of all (but 100 each) of my dark power stone fragments and shards. I began the process of turning 2 dark shard statues into 2 dark crystals. I played longer to do this.

I destroyed several small dark fragment statues.

## Submarine

Previous rewards collected, and new expedition started.

## My base

On Monday/Tuesday at 11:00 pm, my base was raided successfully. I gained 1 diamond from this, but lost some resources, it wasn't too bad, and it helps other players.

## Upgrades

* Artillery level 18/19

* Iron Mine level 8

I really considered spending over 194 diamonds to do another upgrade today, but eventually decided not to
